IBM Workshop with with Damiaan Zwietering

In this workshop we learned about how corona virus acts in different countries and how it can affect the number of deaths and cases. Afterwards, I focused more in Belgium to analyse different factors of corona virus in my local area.

I compared the different causes of death in Belgium from 2017 until 2020. Afterwards, I have added the deaths because of Corona for the year of 2019 and 2020. You can see and compare different causes of mortality in Belgium.
